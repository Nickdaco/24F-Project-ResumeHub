# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

Our pages show what it would look like if you logged in as each of our personas: Student, Recruiter, Co-op advisor, and System Administrator.
Each persona has their own pages and actions they can do, each personas pages are seperated by 10's. i.e all student pages are in the 60's so 61, 62, 63, etc.
